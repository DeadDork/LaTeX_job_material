Resume Document Class
=====================

This is a document class that makes a pretty decent resume, if I may say so myself

Requirements
------------

For starters, you need to get some kind of LaTeX distribution. I have tested this with pdfTeX 3.1415926-1.40.10-2.2 (TeX Live 2009/Debian), which I got from Ubuntu 12.04's apt package repository.

Beyond that, you need the following LaTeX packages:
*	nopageno
*	geometry
*	times
*	paralist
*	atbeginend
*	hyperref
*	color

That should be enough to compile *dummy.tex*.

To Use
------

Open up *dummy.tex* with your favorite text editor, and hack away!

Further instruction, though, goes beyond the scope of this document.

The [LaTeX WikiBook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a good resource if you are interested in getting fancy.

To Compile
----------

Simply compile your *.tex* file in the same directory as *resume.cls*. For example:

		pdflatex dummy.tex

That should create a number of files. If you want to see what the document looks like, open up *dummmy.pdf* with your favorite PDF viewer.

Issues
------

Make sure that you have all of the requisites named above, and try again.

If you still have problems, you are welcome to mark this as an Issue on [the repo's github Issues page](https://github.com/DeadDork/resume_document_class/issues). Be sure to be detailed.

That said, unless it is a problem with the class itself, I probably won't address it in depth. That sort of thing is better resolved on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [The TeX Stack Exchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com).

Happy (job) hunting!
